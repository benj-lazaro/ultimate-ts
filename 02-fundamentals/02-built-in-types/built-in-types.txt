Built-in Types
--------------
- JavaScript has the following built-in (data) types:
    - number
    - string
    - boolean
    - string
    - undefined
    - object


- TypeScript comes with the same built-in types and of the following:
    - any
    - unknown
    - never
    - enum
    - tuple


- In TypeScript
    - A variable is NOT NECESSARILY needed to be annotated with a type

    - The compiler can INFER (detects) the type
        - Based on the assigned initial value

        - NOTE: Hovering the mouse pointer on a variable
            - VS Code reveals the type inferred assign to the variable

    - A variable without an initial value
        - The compiler implicitly annotates it with the type "any"

    - NOTE: A value of type "number"
        - Large value can be VISUALLY SEPARATED using "_"
            - e.g. 10_000_00
