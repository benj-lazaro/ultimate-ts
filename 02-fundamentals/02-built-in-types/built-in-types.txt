Built-in Types
--------------
- JavaScript has built-in types
    - number
    - string
    - boolean
    - string
    - undefined
    - object


- TypeScript has the same built-in types with the adddition of the following:
    - any
    - unknown
    - never
    - enum
    - tuple


- In TypeScript, a variable is NOT necessarily needed to be annotated with a data type
    - The TypeScript compiler infers or detects the data type
        - Based on the initial value

        - NOTE: Hovering the mouse point over a variable
            - VS code reveals the annotated built-in type of a variable

    - For variables without an initial value
        - The TypeScript compiler annotates it with the "any" data type


- NOTE: built-in type of number
    - Large numbers can be visually separated using an underscore (_) character
    - This is ONLY for readability purposes
