The any Type
------------
- The type "any" represents any type of value
    - The compiler implicitly assign the type of "any"
        - To an uninitialized variable

    - NOTE: Explicitly assigning type "any" to a variable
        - Disables the "Type Checking" feature of the language
            - The major benefit of using TypeScript
        
        - AVOID annotating a variable with the type of "any"


- The compiler ALWAYS triggers a compilation error
    - For implicit assignment of type "any" to a vairable

    - To override this setting
        - Open the file "tsconfig.json"
        - Uncomment (i.e. enable) the setting "noImplicitAny"
        - Change the assigned value "true" to "false"
        - Save the changes

        - NOTE: Use with CAUTION
            - Do NOT use it UNLESS you know what you're doing
            - Otherwise, there is NO POINT of using TypeScript
