The any Type
------------
- This represents any types of values
    - TypeScript compiler assigns a type of "any" to an uninitialized variable

    - Assigning a type of "any" to a variable
        - Loses the "type checking" feature
            - The major benefit of using TypeScript

        - Best practice
            - AVOID assigning the type "any" to a variable


- TypeScript compiler ALWAYS triggers a compilation error
    - For implicit assignment of type "any" on a variable
    
    - There is a way to override this setting
        - Open the file "tsconfig.json"
        - Uncomment the setting "noImplicitAny"
        - Change the initial value of "true" to "false"
        - Save the changes

        - NOTE: Use this with CAUTION
            - Do NOT use it UNLESS you know that you are doing
            - Otherwise, there is NO point using TypeScript
            - This loses the "type checking" feature of the language
