Objects
-------
- In JavaScript, an object is dynamic
    - Additional property can be added throughout the execution of the program


- In TypeScript, an object can be explicitly annotated with
    - A property and its corresponding data type

    - A compilation error is triggered
        - Whenever a non-existent property of an object is accessed
        

Syntax

    let <object_name> = { <property>: <value> };

    let <object_name>: { [readonly] <property>: <data_type> } = { <property>: <value> };


- The modifier "readonly"
    - Prefixed on an object's property
    - Prevents the value of a property from being modified / udpated
    
    - An attempt to modify / update a property
        - Triggers a compilation error


- To define a method in an object
    - On the property that stores the method
        - Assign an arrow function as value

    - On the arrow function's parameter, enclosed in ()
        - Define the parameter variable name
        - Followed by its corresponding data type

    - Inside th arrow function's body
        - Return the data type of "void"
