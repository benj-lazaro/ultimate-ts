Objects
-------
- In JavaScript
    - An object is dynamic
    
    - An additional property 
        - Can be added throughout the execution of the program


- In TypeScript
    - An object is also dynamic

    - An additional property can be explicitly annotated
        - With the type of the property & its corresponding valuye



- In JavaScript, an object is dynamic
    - Additional property can be added throughout the execution of the program

    - Triggers a compilation error
        - When accessing a non-existent property of an object 


Syntax

    let <object_name> = { <property>: <value> };

    let <object_name>: { [readonly] <property>: <data_type> } = { <property>: <value> };


- The modifier "readonly"
    - Prefixed on an object's property
        - Prevents the assigned value from being modified or updated

    - An attempt to assign a new value
        - Triggers a compilation error
    

- To define a method in an object
    - Assign an arrow function to the property
        - That will function as a method

    - On the arrow function's parameter list
        - Define the parameter variable(s)
        - Followed by a ":"
        - Then its corresponding type

    - Inside the body of the arrow function
        - Just write "void"
        - It means that the method returns nothing (i.e. void)
