Arrays
------
- To declare an array in TypeScript
    - It is similar to JavaScript

    - It OPTIONALLY provide the ability to explictly annotate 
        - The type of the array's elements

        - By declaring the type right after 
            - The ":" that succeeded after the variable name
            - Within a pair of <>
            - Followed by a pair of []

    - The compiler can infer the type
        - Based on the type of the array's elements


Syntax:

    let <variable_name>: <data_type>[] = [<element_value_1>, <element_value_n>]

    let <variable_name> = [<element_value_1>, <element_value_n>]


- NOTE: When declaring an empty array
    - It is best practice to annotate the array with a specific type

    - This prevents the compiler from implicitly annotating it with type "any"
        - Thus loosing TypeScript's "Type Checking" feature
