Tuples
------
- A tuple is basically a fixed-length array
    - Each element of a tuple has a particular type

    - Internally, it is a JavaScript array
        - With "strict mode" enabled

    - Tuples are often used when working with a pair of values
    
    
- To declare a tuple in TypeScript
    - Annontate the variable with the data type of each element
        - Enclosed within a pair of []

    - Followed by a =
    - Then the tuple elements enclosed within a pair of []


Syntax:

    let <variable_name>: [<data_type_1>, <data_type_n>] = [<data_type_1>, <data_type_n>];


- Best PRACTICE
    - Restrict elements of a tuple to ONLY two (2) values
    - Anything more will make the code difficult to understand


- Triggers a compilation error when
    - An element's type does NOT MATCH with the annotated type
    - The type of an additional new element has NOT been annotated


- NOTE: When using the method ".push()" on a tuple
    - This will NOT trigger a compilation error
    
    - Even it has NO provision to annotate a new element's type
        - The the new element will be added into the tuple
        - Despite being a fixed-length data structure
