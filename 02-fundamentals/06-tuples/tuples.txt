Tuples
------
- A tuple is a FIXED LENGTH array
    - Each element of a tuple has a particular data type
        - Internally a JavaScript array with "strict mode" enabled

    - Tuples are often used when working with a pair of values

    - BEST PRACTICE
        - Restrict tuples to ONLY two (2) values
        - Anything more will make the code difficult to understand

    - A TypeScript compilation error is triggered when
        - An additional element's data type has NOT been declared in the type annotation
        - An element's data type does NOT match with it's declared type annotation


Syntax:

    let <variable_name>: [<data_type_1>, <data_type_n>] = [<data_type_1>, <data_type_n>];


- NOTE: Using the method ".push()" on a tuple will NOT trigger a compilation error
    - Despite having NO provision to annotate the new element's data type    
    - Adding a new element to an otherwise FIXED LENGTH data structure
