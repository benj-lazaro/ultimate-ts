What are Decorators
-------------------
- Decorators are attributes that are applied to
    - Classes and their members (i.e. properties & methods)

    - Offers the ability to change the behavior of said members
        - Add new properties / methods
        - Change the implementation of existing methods
    
    - NOTE: They are frequently used in frameworks like Angular & Vue
        - These frameworks comes with built-in components

    - Under the hood
        - A decorator is basically a function
            - That gets called by the JavaScript runtime (i.e. engine)
        
        - JavaScript runtime executes the code
            - Calls the function
            - In return, returns the corresponding class


- Before writing a Decorator
    - Enable the coresponding TypeScript compiler option
        - Disabled as it is currently an experimental feature
        - Current standards & implementation MIGHT CHANGE on future releases of TypeScript

    - Open the file "tsconfig.json"
        - In the section "Language and Environment"
        - Uncomment the option "experimentalDecorators"
        - Save the changes
