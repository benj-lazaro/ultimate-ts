Understanding the Problem
-------------------------
- Generics addresses the situation that a user-defined class
    - Needs to accomodate data of a different data type
    - It offers a common and reusable solution


- Generics removes the need to
    - Refactor the data type of the properties passed to the constructor() method
        - To use the data type of "any"
        - NOTE: This disables TypeScript's "Type Checking" feature

    - Duplicate the class and create variants of it
        - Then rrefactor the data type of properties passed to the constructor() method
        - To accomodate the data type required by the variant class
