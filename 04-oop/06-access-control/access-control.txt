Access Control Keywords
-----------------------
- Three (3) access modifiers that control access to a class' properties / methods
    - "public"
        - Default control access of a class' properties & methods
            - NO need to use prefix a property / method with "public"

    - "private"
        - Limits access to a property / method ONLY WITHIN its own class

        - Access to a property / method from outside the class
            - Triggers a TypeScript compilation error

        - By convention
            - The property / method name should be prefixed with "_"

        - To access the stored value in a "private" property
            - Create a method that returns the value

        - NOTE: Do NOT use this for storing sentive data (e.g. credit card, password, etc.)
            - This is ONLY used for writing robust code

    - "protected"


Syntax:

    class <class_name> {
        <property_name>: <data_type>;
        ...
        private <property_name>: <data_type>;
        ...
        protected <property_name>: <data_type>;
        ...
    }
