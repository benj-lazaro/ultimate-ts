Private vs Protected Members
----------------------------
- Class members (i.e. property / method) given with the 
    - Access modifier of "protected"
        - Works EXACTLY as "private" members
        - EXCEPT theese members are INHERITED


    - NOTE: Best to avoid using the "protected" access modifier 
        - UNLESS you REALLY KNOW what you are doing
        - BETTER to stick with access modifiers "public" & "private"
