Abstract Classes and Methods
----------------------------
- When creating an Abstract class
    - Prefix the keyword "abstract" 
        - Before the "class" keyword and the name of the class

    - This PREVENTS an abstract class from being instantiated into an object
        - Requires to be EXTENDED by a child class
        - In order to be instantiated into an object


- An Abstract class is like an uncooked meal
    - Another (child) class has to extend it 

    - Methods in an abstract class
        - Has NO implementation
        - Remove the pair of "{ }"
        - Annotated it with the data type of "void"

    - NOTE: Abstract methods ONLY exists WITHIN an abstract class


Syntax:

    abstract class <parent_class_name> {
        ...

        abstract <method_name>(): void;
    }

    class <child_class_name> extends <parent_class_name> {
        ...
    }
