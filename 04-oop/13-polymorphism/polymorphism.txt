Polymorphism
------------
- A core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
    - Polymorphism = many forms
    
    - An object can take many different forms
        - From a single class

    - It provides the opportunity 
        - To implement the "Open Closed" principle


- The "Open Closed "principle states that
    - A class should be OPEN for EXTENSION (i.e. inherit from)
        - And CLOSED for MODIFICATION

    - NOTE: Pragmatically, this principle can NOT be adhered 100% of the time
        - It is costly to do so 
        - It ONLY serves as a GUIDING PRINCIPLE
