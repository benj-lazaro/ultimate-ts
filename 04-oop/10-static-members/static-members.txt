Static Members
--------------
- A static property belong ONLY to a class
    - It does NOT belong to the instantiated object from said class

    - Think of it as a sort-of Global variable
        - Only one (1) instance of this property that is active in memory


- To declare a static property in a class
    - Prefix the class property with the keyword "static"
        - Prefix the "static" class property with the keyword "private"
        - NOTE: Prevents from being accessed / updated anywhere in the code

    - NOTE: Do NOT forget to prefix the property name with "_"


- Declare a static getter method
    - To return the current value of the targeted "private static" class property


Syntax:

    class <class_name> {
        private static _<class_property>: <data_type>;
        ...

        static get <class_method>() {
            return <static_class_property>;
        }

    }
