-----------------------------------
- OOP is one of the many paradigms of programming
    - It is a style or ways of writing code
    - Where in objects are the building blocks of an application


- An object is a unit that contains
    - Data (state)
        - These represent the properties of an object
        - Think of them as variables that ONLY exists inside an object

    - Operations (behavior)
        - These represent the method(s) of an object
        - Think of them as functions inside an object

    - Each object is responsible for a single task
