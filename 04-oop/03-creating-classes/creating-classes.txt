Creating Classes
----------------
- To create an object
    - First create a class   

    - A class is a blueprint for creating objects
        - It is like an object factory

    - Pascal naming convention is used for naming a class

    - The defined properties of a class
        - Is EXCLUSIVELY used by TypeScript ONLY
        - The generated JavaScript code does NOT include this 

- A Constructor is a special function / method inside a class
    - It is used for initializing an object

    - This can NOT have a return data type annotation
        - Because it ALWAYS return an instance of the class

    - The keyword "this" reference the current class
        - Where the constructor is being executed on


Syntax:

    class <name> {
        <property_name>: <data_type>;

        constructor(<property_name>: <data_type>, ... ){
            this.<property_name> = <property_name>;
        }

        <method_name>(<parameter_variable>: <data_type>): void {
            // method body
        }
    }
