Creating Objects
----------------
- To create an object from a class
    - Use the keyword "new"
    - Followed by the name of an existing class
    - Then store the instance of the class (i.e. object) in a variable
    

Syntax:

    let <variable_name> = new <class_name>(
        <value_assigned_to_class_property>,
        ...
    );


- To determine if an object is an instance of a class
    - Use the keyword "instanceof" 
    - Followed by a class name
    - Returns a boolean value of "true" or "false"

    - NOTE: This is useful when identifying a custom object
        - Using the keyword "typeof"
        - ALWAYS return the value "object"

- NOTE: VS Code color code tips
    - Object properties are colored in Blue
    - Object methods are colored in Purple
