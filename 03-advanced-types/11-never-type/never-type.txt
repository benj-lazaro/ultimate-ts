The Never Type
--------------
- The "never" data type represents values that NEVER occurs
    - A data type that is NOT used that often


- A function annotated with "never" data type 
    - Throws a Typescript compilation error
        - Because it can NOT have a reachable end-point

    - Setting the Typescript compiler "allowUnreachableCode" to false
        - Triggers another Typescript compilation error
        - Highlights the piece of code that is NOT reachable (executed)
