The Never Type
--------------
- The "never" data type represents values that NEVER occurs
    - A data type that is NOT used that often

    - Often used to annotate functions
        - That NEVER return or ALWAYS throw an error


- Annotating this data type on a function
    - Throws an Typescript compilation error
    - Due to NOT having a reachable end point


- Updating the Typescript compiler configuration file "tsconfig.json"
    - Setting the "allowUnreachableCode" to false
    - Highlights a line of code that will NOT be reachable (or executed)
