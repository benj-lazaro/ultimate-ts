The Unknown Type
----------------
- The data type "unknown" is used
    - When a situation requires using an "any" type

    - It enforces the TypeScript compiler to perform type checking
        - To ensure that associated method(s) of the target object exists

    - It enforces "type guarding" by narrowing the data type
        - Use "typeof" for primitive data types
        - Use "instanceof" for custom data types 

    - NOTE: "unknown" is PREFERRED over "any"
        - AVOID using the data type "any" at all cost
