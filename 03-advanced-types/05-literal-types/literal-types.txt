Literal Types
-------------
- Limits the assigned value to a variable
    - By annotating the variable with the assigned value

    - A compilation error is triggered when
        - Assigning a variable with a different value
        - From that of the annotated literal type

    - The union operator "|" can be used to 
        - Hardcode two or more literal data types to a variable

    - NOTE: To avoid hardcoding literal types to a variable
        - Use Type alias to define a custom data type

        - Use the union operator "|" for the literal types
            - Then annotate the custom data type to the variable
    

Syntax:

    let <variable_name>: <literal_type> = <assigned_value>;
    let <variable_name>: <literal_type_1> | <literal_type_n> = <assigned_value>;

    type <custom_data_type> = <literal_type_1> | <literal_type_n>;

    let <variable_name>: <custom_data_type> = <assigned_value>;
