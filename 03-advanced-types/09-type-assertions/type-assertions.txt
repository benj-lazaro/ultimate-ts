Type Assertions
---------------
- 1st implementation of Type assertion is to use the keyword "as"

- 2nd implementation is to prefix the expression with a pair of "<>"
    - Inside the pair of "<>" declare the expected data type

- NOTE: Type assertion does NOT perform data type conversion
    - EXPLICITLY informs (asserts) the TypeScript compiler 
        - Of the expected data type from an object


Syntax:

    let <variable_name> = <object_name>.<method_name>() as <expected_data_type>;

    let <variable_name> = <<expected_data_type>> <object_name>.<method_name>();
