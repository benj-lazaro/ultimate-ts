Debugging TypeScript Applications
---------------------------------
- How to debug TypeScript applications in VS Code
    - Open the file "tsconfig.json"

    - On the section "Emit"
        - Uncomment setting "sourceMap"

    - The setting "sourceMap"
        - It is a file that specifies 
        - How each line of the TypeScript code "maps" to generated JavaScript code

    - Save the changes
    

- Recompile the source file (index.ts) via terminal

    tsc

    - A new file named "index.js.map" is created in the folder "dist"


- On the folder "dist"
    - Open the file "index.js.map"

        {"version":3,"file":"index.js","sourceRoot":"","sources":["../src/index.ts"],"names":[],"mappings":";AAAA,IAAI,GAAG,GAAW,EAAE,CAAC"}

    - The content labeled "mappings" contains the "map"
        - This is meant to be read by a debugger; NOT humans


- On the folder "src"
    - Open the file "index.ts"

    - Update the source by adding an "if" statement

        if (age < 50) age += 10;


    - Insert a breakpoint on the "let" statement
        - By clicking the left-hand side of the code's line number

        - Starting from this breakpoint
            - The code will then be executed line-by-line

    - Click VS Code's "Run and Debug" panel (CTRL + SHIFT + D)
        - Click the link "create a launch.json file"
            - Creates a file "launch.json"
            - This informs VS Code how to debug this application

        - Select "Node.js" from the provided drop-down list of options
            - Node.js will be used to launch the file "launch.json"


    - On the "launch.json" file
        - Right after the setting "program"
        
        - Add the setting "preLaunchTask"
            - Assign the value "tsc: build - tsconfig.json"

            "program": "${file}",
            "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",

            // Alternative settings
            "program": "${file}",
            "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - 01-getting-started/06-debugging-ts-apps/code/tsconfig.json",


        - This setting informs VS Code
            - To use the TypeScript compiler
            - To build this application using the config file "tsconfig.json"

        - Save the changes

    
    - Switch back the "index.ts"
        - Click VS Code's "Run and Debug" panel (CTRL + SHIFT + D)

        - Click the button "Launch Program" or press F5

        - Breakpoint "pointer" stop at Line 01
            - This is where the breakpoint was created

        - The "Step Over" (F10)
            - Executes one line of code at a time

        - The "Step Into" (F11)
            - Steps into a function

        - The "Step Out" (SHIFT + F11)
            - Steps out from a function

        - The "Restart" (SHIFT + CTRL + F5)
            - Restarts the debugging process

        - The "Stop" (SHIFT + F5)
            - Stops the debugging

        - On the left-hand panel
            - Expanding "VARIABLES"
                - Displays the detected "Global" & "Local" variables used by the application

            - Expanding "WATCH"
                - Allows to add variables to be watched
                    - Click the "+"
                    - Followed by the name of a variable

                - To remove a variable
                    - Click the corresponding "x"
