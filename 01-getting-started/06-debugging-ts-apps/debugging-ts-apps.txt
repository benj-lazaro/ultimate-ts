Debugging TypeScript Applications
---------------------------------
- To debug TypeScript code
    - Open the JSON file "tsconfig.json"

    - Uncomment (i.e. enable) the setting "sourceMap"
        - Leave the default value of "true" as is
    
    - This generates a file with the extension of ".map"
        - It specifies how each line in the TypeScript code
            - Maps to the "compiled" JavaScript code

    - Save the changes

 
- Recompile the source file (index.ts) via terminal

    tsc

    - Create a new file named "index.js.map"
        - In the folder "dist"


- Opening the file "index.js.map"
    - Reveals the content

        {"version":3,"file":"index.js","sourceRoot":"","sources":["../src/index.ts"],"names":[],"mappings":";AAAA,IAAI,GAAG,GAAW,EAAE,CAAC;AAErB,IAAI,GAAG,GAAG,EAAE;IAAE,GAAG,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC;AAExB,OAAO,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,GAAG,CAAC,CAAC"}


    - The content labeled "mappings" contains the "map"
        - This is meant to be read by a debugger
        - NOT meant to be read byhumans


- To demonstate
    - Update the content of "index.ts"
    
    - Add an "if" statement

        if (age < 50) age += 10;


    - On the "let" statement
        - Insert a breakpoint 

        - From this breakpoint
            - The code will be executed line-by-line

        - Save the changes


    - Click the "Run and Debug" panel
        - Shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + Debug

        - This creates a file "launch.json"
            - Informs VS Code how to debug this application

        - From the drop-down list, select "Node.js"
            - Node.js will be used to launch the "launch.json" file

    - Open the file "launch.json"
        - Right after the property "program"

        - Add a new property named "preLaunchTask"
            - Assign the value of "tsc: build - tsconfig.json"

                "program": "${file}",
                "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",

            - Alternatively, a absoulte path to the "tsconfig.json" file can be used

                "program": "${file}",
                "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - 01-getting-started/06-debugging-ts-apps/code/tsconfig.json",

        - Save the changes

        - This informs VS Code to:
            - Use the TypeScript compiler
            - Use the configuration file to build the application


    - Switching back to the "index.ts" file
        - Click VS Code's "Run and Debug" panel (CTRL + SHIFT + D)

        - Click the button "Launch Program" or press F5

        - Breakpoint "pointer" stop at Line 01
            - This is where the breakpoint was created

        - The "Step Over" (F10)
            - Executes one line of code at a time

        - The "Step Into" (F11)
            - Steps into a function

        - The "Step Out" (SHIFT + F11)
            - Steps out from a function

        - The "Restart" (SHIFT + CTRL + F5)
            - Restarts the debugging process

        - The "Stop" (SHIFT + F5)
            - Stops the debugging

        - On the left-hand panel
            - Expanding "VARIABLES"
                - Displays the detected "Global" & "Local" variables used by the application

            - Expanding "WATCH"
                - Allows to add variables to be watched
                    - Click the "+"
                    - Followed by the name of a variable

                - To remove a variable
                    - Click the corresponding "x"
