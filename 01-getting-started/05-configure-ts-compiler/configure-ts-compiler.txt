Configuring the TypeScript Compiler
-----------------------------------
- To create a configuration for the TypeScript compiler via terminal

    tsc --init


    - Creates a new file named "tsconfig.json"
    - Prompts the default settings on the terminal

   
- To configure the TypeScript compiler settings
    - Open the file "tsconfig.json"

    - By default, most of the settings are COMMENTED OUT

    - The setting "target"
        - Specifies the JavaScript version that the TypeScript compiler
            - Will use to generated the corresponding JavaScript code
        
        - By default, it is set to "ES2016"
            - It is considered an old standard & implemented on all browsers
            - NOTE: This is the SAFEST ECMASCript version 

        - To display supported ECMASCript versions
            - Delete "ES2016"
            - Press CTRL + SPACE
            - A list of valid ECMASCript versions


    - The setting "rootDir"
        - Specifies the folder that contains the source file(s) i.e. TypeScript code
        
        - Uncomment this setting
        
        - On the project folder
            - Create a new folder named "src"
            - Move the recently created file "index.ts" into the folder
            - Then delete the generated JavaScript file "index.js"

        - Change the initial value to "./src"


    - The setting "outDir"
        - Specifies the folder that contains the generated JavaScript file(s)

        - Uncomment this setting

        - On the project folder
            - Create a new folder named "dist"

        - Change the initial value to "./dist"


    - The setting "removeComments"
        - Specifies the TypeScript compiler to remove ALL comments from the TypeScript code
            - To ensure that the generated JavaScript is shorter

        - Uncomment this setting
            - Leave the default value of "true" as is


    - The setting "noEmitOnError"
        - By default, the TypeScript compiler will generate the corresponding JavaScript code
            - Despite the presence of error(s) in the TypeScript code

        - Uncomment this setting
            - Leave the default value of "true" as is

        - Enabling this setting
            - Prevents the TypeScript compiler from generating JavaScript code
            - Whenever a TypeScript code error(s) is/are present


    - Save the changes


- Recompile the previously created "index.ts" on the terminal

    tsc


    - NO need to specify the source file (i.e. index.ts)
        - TypeScript compiler picks up source file(s) from the folder "src"
        - Store the generated JavaScript file(s) to the folder "dist"
