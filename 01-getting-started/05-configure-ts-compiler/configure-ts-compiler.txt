Configuring the TypeScript Compiler
-----------------------------------
- To configure the TypeScript compiler
    - Requires a configuration file


- To create a TypeScript configuration file
    - On the integrated terminal, type the command

        tsc --iniit

    - It creates a JSON file named "tsconfig.json"

    - Then displays the default settings of the TypeScript compiler


- To configure the compiler
    - Open the JSON file named "tsconfig.json"

    - By default
        - MOST of the settings are commented (i.e. disabled)

    - The settings named "target"
        - Refers to the JavaScript version that the compiler
            - Will use to generate the corresponding JavaScript code

        - By default, it is set to "ES2016"
            - This is the SAFEST version of the ECMASCript specification
            - It is considered an old standard
            - It's features are implementated on ALL browsers

        - To display other supported ECMASCript versions
            - Delete the current "ES2016"
            
            - Then press CTRL + SPACE
                - Drop-down menu lists all valid ECMASCript versions


    - The settings named "rootDir"
        - Refers to the folder that contains the source files
            - Source files = TypeScript code

        - This is the folder where the compiler will search
            - To compile TypeScript into JavaScript code

        - By default, this is set to an empty string
            - Common convention has the value "./src" assigned to it

        - In the project folder
            - Create a new folder named "src"

        - Back on the configuration file
            - Uncomment (i.e. enable) this setting
            - Assign the initial value of "./src"

    
    - The setting "outDir"
        - Refers to the folder where the "compiled" JavaScript code
            - Will be stored afterwards

        - By default, this is set to an empty string
            - Common convention has the value "./dist" assigned to it

        - In the project folder
            - Create a new folder named "dist"

        - Back on the configuration file
            - Uncomment (i.e. enable) this setting
            - Assign the initial value of "./dist"


    - The setting "removeComments"
        - Informs the compiler to REMOVE ALL comments from the TypeScript code
            - This ensure that the "compiled" JavaScript code is shorter

        - Uncomment (i.e. enable) this setting
            - Leave the default value of "true" as is


    - The setting "noEmitOnError"
        - This prevents the compiler from "compiling" TypeScript into JavaScript
            - When an error in TypeScript is present

        - By default, the compiler proceeds with the compilation
            - Even if an error in TypeScript is present

        - Uncomment (i.e. enable) this setting
            - Leave the default value of "true" as is


    - Save the changes


- Recompile the previously created "index.ts" using the command
    
    tsc

    - With the compiler configured
        - There is NOT need to specify the source file (e.g. index.ts)
        - The compiler picks up the source file(s) from the folder "./src"
        - Then stores the "compiled" JavaScript code in the folder "./dist"
