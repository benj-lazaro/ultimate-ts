Your First TypeScript Program
-----------------------------
- Create a new file named "index.ts"
    - A TypeScript code has the filename extension of ".ts"


- Declare a new variable named "age"
    - Annotate the data type of the variable
        - Which is a "number"

    - This is performed by
        - Placing a ":" RIGHT AFTER the name of the variable
        - Followed by the intended data type (e.g. number)
        - Then a "=" and the initial value
        - End the statement with a ";"
        
            let age: number = 20;

        - NOTE: This is known as "Type Annotation"


- Compile the TypeScript code
    - Open VS Code's integrated terminal

    - Compile the file "index.ts"

        tsc index.ts

    - A corresponding JavaScript file of the same name will be generated
        - NOTE: It has the filename extension of ".js"

    - Opening the JavaScript file reveals similar code with that of TypeScript
        - EXCEPT the Type Annotation of the variable is GONE


- By default, the TypeScript compiler uses
    - The ES5 implementation of JavaScript

    - ECMAScript is the standard SPECIFICATION of a language
        - JavaScript is the IMPLEMENTATION of the ECMAScript specification

    - ES5 or more specifically ES2015 is an old standard / specification
        - Most of its features have been implementation on ALL browsers
