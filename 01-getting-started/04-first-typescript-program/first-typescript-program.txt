Your First TypeScript Program
-----------------------------
- Create a new file named "index.ts"
    - Every TypeScript file should have the file extension ".ts"
    

- Declare a variable named "age"
    - Annotate with it with the data type of "number"
        - By typing a ":" followed by a variable (i.e. number)
        - This annotates or explains the value assigned to the variable
        
        - NOTE: This is purely for the TypeScript compiler ONLY
            - The TRANSPILED JavaScript code does NOT carry over said annotation

    - Assign the variable "age" with an initial value of 20

        let age: number = 20;


- Then compile the TypeScript file on terminal

    tsc index.ts


- Produces a corresponding JavaScript file named "index.js"
    - Contains the corresponding JavaScript code

        var age = 20;

    - By default, the TypeScript compiler uses the ES5 implementation of JavaScript
        - ECMAScript is the standard or specification of a language
        - JavaScript is the implementation of said ECMAScript standard / specification

    - ES5 or ES2015 is an old standard / specification 
        - It has been around for a long-time
        - Most of its features have been implemented on all browsers
