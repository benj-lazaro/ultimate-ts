What is TypeScript
------------------
- TypeScript is a programming language
    - Created by Microsoft

    - Designed to address the shortcomings of JavaScript

    - Built on top of JavaScript
        - Essentially a JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file


- Benefits
    - Static Typing
        - Able to identify the data type of a variable at compile time / during coding
        - TypeScript is essentially "JavaScript with Type Checking"

    - Code Completion
    - Refactoring
    - Shorthand Notations 
        - Supported by modern-day code editors
        - That offers these productivity features


- Drawbacks
    - The complitation step is ALWAYS involved
        - Due to modern-day browsers do NOT undrestand TypeScript code

        - Requires for the TypeScript compilter to TRANSLATE TypeScript into JavaScript code
            - This process is known as TRANSPILATION

    - Requires discipline (and fore thought) when writing TypeScript code
        - Discourages writing code quickly

        - More time is wasted on coding large projects in JavaScript
            - This requires time to catch nasty bugs

        - Recommended to use
            - TypeScript for meduim to large projects
            - JavaScript for simple projects
