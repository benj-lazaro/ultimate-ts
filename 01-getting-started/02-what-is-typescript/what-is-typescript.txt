What is TypeScript
------------------
- TypeScript is a programming language created by Microsoft
    - To address shortcomings of JavaScript
    
    - It is built on top of JavaScript
        - Every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file


- It offers the following benefits
    - Static typing
        - Ability to identify the data type of a variable at compile time or while coding
        - TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with Type Checking
    
    - Code completion
    - Refactoring
    - Shorthand notations
        - Modern-day code editors support the TypeScript language
        - It offer productivity features such as code completion, refactoring & shorthand notations


- TypeScript drawbacks
    - A compilation step is ALWAYS involved
        - Modern-day browsers do NOT undrestand TypeScript code

        - The TypeScript compiler TRANSLATES TypeScript code into plain JavaScript
            - A process known as "Transpilation"

    - Requires discipline when writing code
        - Discourages in getting things done quickly (e.g. lazy)

        - It wastes more time coding large projects in plain JavaScript
            - As this requires more time catching nasty bugs

        - Preferably use
            - TypeScript for meduim to large projects
            - JavaScript for simple projects
