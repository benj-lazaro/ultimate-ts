What is TypeScript
------------------
- TypeScript is a programming language created by Microsoft
    - Designed to address the shortcomings of JavaScript

    - It is built on top of JavaScript
        - Essentially a JavaScript code is a VALID TypeScript code


- Benefits
    - Static Typing
        - Identify the data type of a variable during coding
        - TypeScript = JavaScript with Type Checking

    - Code Completion

    - Refactoring

    - Shorthand Notations
        - Supported by modern-day code editors
            - Offers productivity features


- Drawbacks
    - Compilation step is ALWAYS involved
        - As modern-day browsers do NOT UNDERSTAND TypeScript code

    - Requires the TypeScript compilter
        - To translate TypeScript into JavaScript code
        - Process known as Transpilation
    
    - Requires discipline and forethought when writing TypeScript code
        - Discourages writing code quickly


- More time is wasted when writing large projects in JavaScript
    - Due to the time to catch nasty (and subtle) bugs


- Rule of thumb
    - Use TypeScript for meduim to large projects
    - Use JavaScript for small (simple) projects
